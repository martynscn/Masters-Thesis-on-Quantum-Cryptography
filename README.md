# Master's Thesis: Shor's algorithm in Quantum Cryptography

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks containing the codes used in the Quantum simulations of different variants of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm. While IBM Qiskit has already implemented the algorithm using the standard Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), this project goes further to implement the algorithm using the Semiclassical QFT. This new variant helps in optimizing the number of qubits needed for quantum computation.
